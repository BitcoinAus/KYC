# KYC

## Abstract
Using uPort or other wallets and ERC780 contracts to make portable KYC attestations.  Users will be able to verify their idenity once, use many across financial services.  This demo is on the Rinkeby network.

This code will enable white label KYC portals to be deployed.

## Process
The process to add a new user to the KYC smart contract is:
1. New users visits the portal https://id.blockchainaustralia.org
2. Complete an online form
3. The website is configured to use a reputal KYC vendor, such as RaidID
4. A call to RapidID's REST API is posted
5. If verified, the data is hashed and submitted to the Ethereum blockchain

## Claim types
Based on the 100 Point ID check Australia.  

| Key | Class | Document Type | Point Value | Key as Bytes32 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BIRTHCERTIFICATE | Primary | Birth Certificate | 70 | 0x42495254484345525449464943415445 |
| DRIVERSLICENCE | Secondary | Driverâ€™s Licence | 40 | 0x445249564552534c4943454e4345 |

Classes represented in the smart contract as an enum
```
enum Class {
    Primary,
    Secondary
}
```

Once documents have been certified, their Key and the hash of the JSON object are added to the users public key.

```
struct Document {
	Key,
	Hash,
	Date,
	Verified
}
```


## Proxy contract



## Document taxonomy

Primary and secondary documents are represented as JSON in the following formats.  The hash of the document is then added to the ERC780 register.

``
{
	'BIRTHCERTIFICATE': '0x00'
}
``

### BIRTHCERTIFICATE

| Key | Eg Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Key | BIRTHCERTIFICATE |
| Name | JOHN DOE |
| Issued | 2018-01-01 |

```
{
    Key: 'BIRTHCERTIFICATE',
    Name: 'JOHN DOE',
    Issued: '2018-01-01'
    Documents: [

    ]
}
```

```
{
	BirthDate: '2005-08-21',
	FamilyName: 'Smith',
	GivenName: 'Larry',
	RegistrationState: 'NSW',
	RegistrationDate: '2005-08-27',
	RegistrationYear: '2005',
	RegistrationNumber: '500156',
	CertificateNumber: '1758461',
	DatePrinted: '2012-07-27'
}
```

### DRIVERSLICENCE
```
{
	BirthDate: '1985-02-08',
	FamilyName: 'Lee',
	GivenName: 'Mary',
	LicenceNumber: '94977000',
	StateOfIssue: 'ACT',
    Country: 'AUS'
}
```

```

## Contract specs

The contract to holds clients KYC attestations will adhere to ERC780.  We are using the uPort contract ``, deployed on Rinkeby at `0xc9ed21ffcc88a5072454c43bdfdbbe3430888b19`.

## Validating 100 points
The "100" points proxy contract will iterate through the underling claims contact `0xc9ed21ffcc88a5072454c43bdfdbbe3430888b19`.  Using the key and points values from the above table, will then aggrate the total.

```
contract Points {
    
}
```
